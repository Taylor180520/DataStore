Examples of services that are often outsourced include: · Office cleaning; · Canteen and catering services; · Payroll services; · IT services; · Security services. · Outsourcing is not limited to providing services; parts of manufacturing processes also may be outsourced. This trend has been strengthened by the reduced costs of international trade; many components may be made in lower-cost economies, and the assembly of the final products may take place closer to the markets in which the products are sold. · The decision companies may have to make, therefore, is whether to make components in-house or to buy them from an external supplier. · Advantages of Outsourcing: · Lower cost. Many companies have discovered that some goods or services may be purchased for less than it would cost to provide them internally. This may be due to the economies of scale enjoyed by the third-party provider. · Services may become a variable cost rather than a fixed cost if outsourced. For example, the cost of outsourcing payroll services may be based on the number of personnel. If payroll services were sourced in-house, staff would have to be employed to provide this service (i.e. effectively a fixed or stepped cost). · Outsourcing allows management to focus on the core competencies of the business without being distracted by managing peripheral areas. · A specialist supplier may be able to supply goods or services of higher quality. · Access to a broader range of expertise as the provider deals with several clients. For example, a provider of IT services may have employees with a wider range of skills and knowledge than an internal IT function. · Disadvantages of Outsourcing: · The company relies on a third party to provide a reliable supply. Therefore, it loses control over a part of its business processes. · Outsourcing may mean trusting a third party with confidential information about goods or services. · Some costs may not be apparent (i.e. hidden) as anything not explicitly covered by the contract will incur additional charges. · Quality may suffer, especially if the contract price per unit is fixed (i.e. the third party can only increase its profit by reducing costs). · Operational dependence on the outsourcing company is linked to its financial stability. Switching to another provider may be very costly if the third-party company fails. · Outsourcing may demotivate the workforce if the decision to outsource is associated with job losses. (There may also be bad publicity where outsourcing is to another country.) · When deciding whether to outsource the manufacture of a particular component, organisations will obviously want to calculate the financial effect. Although financial impact will not be the only factor to be considered, it will likely be significant. · If a company outsources all production of an item, there will be no in-house production. This may lead to some fixed cost savings since less production capacity will be required. · The approach here is to determine the costs saved if in-house production ceases, including any incremental fixed costs, and compare this with the costs of buying-in the component from an external supplier.,重点: true})"

However, before such decisions are taken, managers must know which relevant costs would be saved if the division were closed down. · In particular, the head office may have allocated fixed costs to the division. These may not be saved if the division is closed down. Non-incremental costs should be ignored in decision making. · When making shutdown decisions, management should consider non-financial factors as well as whether losses can be reduced. For example: · If closing a division would result in redundancies, this could lead to poor morale among remaining employees. · The permanent loss of resources and specific skills may mean that it will not be possible to take advantage of future opportunities. · Shutting down one division may affect demand for products produced by other divisions (e.g. if customers like to buy a range of products from one supplier, closing a particular division will limit the range that is available). · It may be possible to bring a loss-making division back to profitability by developing new products or services. · Shutting down a division may make it possible to sell assets such as buildings to raise finance for other divisions or to reduce debt. · Rolling Co has four divisions: North, South, East and West.

"(:知识点 {中文: 外包,考点: true,难点: false,回顾: false,标题: Outsourcing,内容: Outsourcing is buying goods or services externally rather than making or providing them internally. · For many years, there has been a trend towards outsourcing non-core services. Examples of services that are often outsourced include: · Office cleaning; · Canteen and catering services; · Payroll services; · IT services; · Security services. · Outsourcing is not limited to providing services; parts of manufacturing processes also may be outsourced. This trend has been strengthened by the reduced costs of international trade; many components may be made in lower-cost economies, and the assembly of the final products may take place closer to the markets in which the products are sold. · The decision companies may have to make, therefore, is whether to make components in-house or to buy them from an external supplier. · Advantages of Outsourcing: · Lower cost. Many companies have discovered that some goods or services may be purchased for less than it would cost to provide them internally. This may be due to the economies of scale enjoyed by the third-party provider. · Services may become a variable cost rather than a fixed cost if outsourced. For example, the cost of outsourcing payroll services may be based on the number of personnel. If payroll services were sourced in-house, staff would have to be employed to provide this service (i.e. effectively a fixed or stepped cost). · Outsourcing allows management to focus on the core competencies of the business without being distracted by managing peripheral areas. · A specialist supplier may be able to supply goods or services of higher quality. · Access to a broader range of expertise as the provider deals with several clients. For example, a provider of IT services may have employees with a wider range of skills and knowledge than an internal IT function. · Disadvantages of Outsourcing: · The company relies on a third party to provide a reliable supply. Therefore, it loses control over a part of its business processes. · Outsourcing may mean trusting a third party with confidential information about goods or services. · Some costs may not be apparent (i.e. hidden) as anything not explicitly covered by the contract will incur additional charges. · Quality may suffer, especially if the contract price per unit is fixed (i.e. the third party can only increase its profit by reducing costs). · Operational dependence on the outsourcing company is linked to its financial stability. Switching to another provider may be very costly if the third-party company fails. · Outsourcing may demotivate the workforce if the decision to outsource is associated with job losses. (There may also be bad publicity where outsourcing is to another country.) · When deciding whether to outsource the manufacture of a particular component, organisations will obviously want to calculate the financial effect. Although financial impact will not be the only factor to be considered, it will likely be significant. · If a company outsources all production of an item, there will be no in-house production. This may lead to some fixed cost savings since less production capacity will be required. · The approach here is to determine the costs saved if in-house production ceases, including any incremental fixed costs, and compare this with the costs of buying-in the component from an external supplier.,重点: true})",[:属于],"(:章节 {中文: 相关成本分析,标题: Relevant cost analysis,编号: 4,内容: 本章涵盖以下学习目标：

This allows the equations to be shown as straight lines on a graph. ✧The graph can be used to identify the optimal solution. ✧The optimal solution must be solved algebraically (e.g. using simultaneous equations). The process of graphing a linear programming model includes the following steps: Step 1 Define unknowns. For example, x = Number of units of output of one of the products and y = Number of units of output of the other product. Step 2 Formulate the objective function, either to maximise contribution or to minimise cost. Remember to use contribution, not profit. Step 3 Express constraints in terms of inequalities (including non-negativity). Constraints (limiting factors) may include resource constraints, production constraints and/or levels of demand. Step 4 Plot all constraints on a graph and identify the feasible region. Having drawn the graph, the optimal solution can be solved using one of two methods: ✧The objective function method − also referred to as the iso-contribution method. This enables the solution to be read from the graph (if the graph is drawn accurately). ✧The simultaneous equation method.})"

There are two options to choose from. Nottingham Co should choose the option with the lowest relevant cost: Option 1 − hiring agency staff to cover for the three staff who will work on the contract. The relevant cost is the incremental cost − which is the cost of the agency staff, which is $21,400. Option 2 − three regular staff would cover the work of the staff who will work on the contract, and agency staff will be used to cover their work. The relevant cost is the agency cost of $18,000. Option 2 has the lowest relevant cost, so would be used. The relevant cost is therefore $18,000.

Examples of services that are often outsourced include: · Office cleaning; · Canteen and catering services; · Payroll services; · IT services; · Security services. · Outsourcing is not limited to providing services; parts of manufacturing processes also may be outsourced. This trend has been strengthened by the reduced costs of international trade; many components may be made in lower-cost economies, and the assembly of the final products may take place closer to the markets in which the products are sold. · The decision companies may have to make, therefore, is whether to make components in-house or to buy them from an external supplier. · Advantages of Outsourcing: · Lower cost. Many companies have discovered that some goods or services may be purchased for less than it would cost to provide them internally. This may be due to the economies of scale enjoyed by the third-party provider. · Services may become a variable cost rather than a fixed cost if outsourced. For example, the cost of outsourcing payroll services may be based on the number of personnel. If payroll services were sourced in-house, staff would have to be employed to provide this service (i.e. effectively a fixed or stepped cost). · Outsourcing allows management to focus on the core competencies of the business without being distracted by managing peripheral areas. · A specialist supplier may be able to supply goods or services of higher quality. · Access to a broader range of expertise as the provider deals with several clients. For example, a provider of IT services may have employees with a wider range of skills and knowledge than an internal IT function. · Disadvantages of Outsourcing: · The company relies on a third party to provide a reliable supply. Therefore, it loses control over a part of its business processes. · Outsourcing may mean trusting a third party with confidential information about goods or services. · Some costs may not be apparent (i.e. hidden) as anything not explicitly covered by the contract will incur additional charges. · Quality may suffer, especially if the contract price per unit is fixed (i.e. the third party can only increase its profit by reducing costs). · Operational dependence on the outsourcing company is linked to its financial stability. Switching to another provider may be very costly if the third-party company fails. · Outsourcing may demotivate the workforce if the decision to outsource is associated with job losses. (There may also be bad publicity where outsourcing is to another country.) · When deciding whether to outsource the manufacture of a particular component, organisations will obviously want to calculate the financial effect. Although financial impact will not be the only factor to be considered, it will likely be significant. · If a company outsources all production of an item, there will be no in-house production.

Material ($5 per kg)	25	30
Labour ($20 per hour)	80	100
Variable overhead	30	44

In the next period, maximum demand for each product will be 60,000 units of Cee and 45,000 units of Dee. Material will be restricted to 500,000 kg.
What is the shadow price of material?
A.$0
B.$8
C.$16
D.$21,回顾: false,答案: The correct answer is C.
Firstly check whether material is a constraint.
Cee material used per unit = $25/$5 kg = 5 kg
Dee material used per unit = $30/$5 kg = 6 kg
Total material used = (60,000 * 5) kg + (45,000 * 6) kg = 570,000 kg
This is greater than 500,000 kg, indicating material is a constraint.
Contribution per unit of Cee = $240 − $25 − $80 − $30 = $105
Contribution per unit of Dee = $270 − $30 − $100 − $44 = $96
Contribution per unit of scarce resource
Cee = $105/5 = $21, Dee = $96/6 = $16
Cee will be produced first. Material requirements for Cee = 60,000 * 5kg = 300,000 kg, less than the 500,000 kg available, so the shadow price will be the contribution per unit of scarce resource for Dee as production of Dee will be restricted.,标题: Shadow Price of Material})",[:考察],"(:知识点 {考点: false,难点: false,回顾: false,标题: Shadow Price under one limiting factor,重点: false,内容: the additional contribution that would be generated if one more unit of the scarce resource were to become available.

"(:知识点 {中文: 外包,考点: true,难点: false,回顾: false,标题: Outsourcing,内容: Outsourcing is buying goods or services externally rather than making or providing them internally. · For many years, there has been a trend towards outsourcing non-core services. Examples of services that are often outsourced include: · Office cleaning; · Canteen and catering services; · Payroll services; · IT services; · Security services. · Outsourcing is not limited to providing services; parts of manufacturing processes also may be outsourced. This trend has been strengthened by the reduced costs of international trade; many components may be made in lower-cost economies, and the assembly of the final products may take place closer to the markets in which the products are sold. · The decision companies may have to make, therefore, is whether to make components in-house or to buy them from an external supplier. · Advantages of Outsourcing: · Lower cost. Many companies have discovered that some goods or services may be purchased for less than it would cost to provide them internally. This may be due to the economies of scale enjoyed by the third-party provider. · Services may become a variable cost rather than a fixed cost if outsourced. For example, the cost of outsourcing payroll services may be based on the number of personnel. If payroll services were sourced in-house, staff would have to be employed to provide this service (i.e. effectively a fixed or stepped cost). · Outsourcing allows management to focus on the core competencies of the business without being distracted by managing peripheral areas. · A specialist supplier may be able to supply goods or services of higher quality. · Access to a broader range of expertise as the provider deals with several clients. For example, a provider of IT services may have employees with a wider range of skills and knowledge than an internal IT function. · Disadvantages of Outsourcing: · The company relies on a third party to provide a reliable supply. Therefore, it loses control over a part of its business processes. · Outsourcing may mean trusting a third party with confidential information about goods or services. · Some costs may not be apparent (i.e. hidden) as anything not explicitly covered by the contract will incur additional charges. · Quality may suffer, especially if the contract price per unit is fixed (i.e. the third party can only increase its profit by reducing costs). · Operational dependence on the outsourcing company is linked to its financial stability. Switching to another provider may be very costly if the third-party company fails. · Outsourcing may demotivate the workforce if the decision to outsource is associated with job losses. (There may also be bad publicity where outsourcing is to another country.) · When deciding whether to outsource the manufacture of a particular component, organisations will obviously want to calculate the financial effect. Although financial impact will not be the only factor to be considered, it will likely be significant. · If a company outsources all production of an item, there will be no in-house production. This may lead to some fixed cost savings since less production capacity will be required. · The approach here is to determine the costs saved if in-house production ceases, including any incremental fixed costs, and compare this with the costs of buying-in the component from an external supplier.,重点: true})",[:测试],"(:测试题 {题目: The following statements have been made about outsourcing:

If an activity is performed internally the organisation may incur additional fixed costs that it would not otherwise incur (e.g. salaries of staff performing the activity).

Information about the products is as follows:

Material ($5 per kg)	25	30
Labour ($20 per hour)	80	100

In the next period, maximum demand for each product will be 60,000 units of Cee and 45,000 units of Dee. Material will be restricted to 500,000 kg.
What is the shadow price of material?
A.$0
B.$8
C.$16
D.$21,回顾: false,答案: The correct answer is C.
Firstly check whether material is a constraint.
Cee material used per unit = $25/$5 kg = 5 kg
Dee material used per unit = $30/$5 kg = 6 kg
Total material used = (60,000 * 5) kg + (45,000 * 6) kg = 570,000 kg
This is greater than 500,000 kg, indicating material is a constraint.
Contribution per unit of Cee = $240 − $25 − $80 − $30 = $105
Contribution per unit of Dee = $270 − $30 − $100 − $44 = $96
Contribution per unit of scarce resource
Cee = $105/5 = $21, Dee = $96/6 = $16
Cee will be produced first. Material requirements for Cee = 60,000 * 5kg = 300,000 kg, less than the 500,000 kg available, so the shadow price will be the contribution per unit of scarce resource for Dee as production of Dee will be restricted.,标题: Shadow Price of Material})"

For ✧profit maximisation (which is always by maximising contribution); ✧cost minimisation. ✧Based on the assumption that the objective and the constraints may be expressed as linear equations. ✧The syllabus only includes situations involving two variables. This allows the equations to be shown as straight lines on a graph. ✧The graph can be used to identify the optimal solution. ✧The optimal solution must be solved algebraically (e.g. using simultaneous equations). The process of graphing a linear programming model includes the following steps: Step 1 Define unknowns. For example, x = Number of units of output of one of the products and y = Number of units of output of the other product. Step 2 Formulate the objective function, either to maximise contribution or to minimise cost. Remember to use contribution, not profit. Step 3 Express constraints in terms of inequalities (including non-negativity). Constraints (limiting factors) may include resource constraints, production constraints and/or levels of demand. Step 4 Plot all constraints on a graph and identify the feasible region.
